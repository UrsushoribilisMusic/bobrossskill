# Bob Ross Mode

The robot arm holds a pen and draws on paper while the Evan voice narrates in Bob Ross style, powered by a local Qwen model via Ollama.

## Full flow

1. **Readiness check** — verifies arm, calibration, and Ollama are ready
2. **Warning tone** — 3 beeps so humans step clear
3. **Intro** — "We got a lovely request for..."
4. **Draw + live commentary** — arm draws while Bob Ross narrates in the background
5. **Outro** — "Finished, you can remove your piece now"

## Commands

### Write text
```bash
python3 bob_ross.py write "OpenClaw"
python3 bob_ross.py write "Hello World" --size 15
```

### Draw a shape
```bash
python3 bob_ross.py draw square
python3 bob_ross.py draw circle
python3 bob_ross.py draw triangle
python3 bob_ross.py draw demo
python3 bob_ross.py draw square --size 40
```

### Check system readiness (without drawing)
```bash
python3 bob_ross.py check
```

### Skip voice (draw silently)
```bash
python3 bob_ross.py write "Test" --no-voice
```

## Stop the arm

Send `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) or `SIGTERM` to the process. The arm will:
1. Stop the drawing subprocess
2. Lift the pen to a safe height
3. Say "The arm has been stopped"

To stop via OpenClaw, ask to "stop the arm" or "stop bob ross" and the agent will send SIGTERM to the running process.

## Notes

- Always position the pen touching the paper before running.
- Calibration lives at `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/huenit/calibration.json`.
- Narration is generated by `qwen2.5:7b` running locally via Ollama.
- If Ollama is unreachable, a built-in fallback narration is used automatically.
- The `HUENIT_PORT` environment variable overrides the auto-detected port.
